# Counter-Strike: Source Offensive Test Build - Old CS:GO Sounds

this project is basically porting the csgo old sounds community sound addon from CSSO 1.1 (image below) to the CSSO Test Builds.

the only differences is that this port uses the sound script based from the vanilla sound script and doesn't use recompiled models.
